SpaceJam was created using the Boo programming language on the Unity 3D engine in March 2013.
In writing this code, I taught myself the principles of object oriented programming
as required to build a functional game in as small a time-frame as possible.

Starting with no knowledge of Unity 3D or OOP, I completed the demo above in
a little over three weeks, with various detours and explorations of the engine
along the way.

Future refactoring and possible additions:  
- [ ] Merge classes for various asteroid types
- [ ] Refactor for better encapsulation and general aesthetics
- [ ] Add level-ending mechanism or some completion objective
